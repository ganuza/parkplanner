## Deployed Link
[ParkPlanner](https://parkplanner.vercel.app/)

### **ABSTRACT**
This project was assigned as part of Turing School of Software Design module 3 front end.  The purpose of this showcase solo project was to show all of the technologies we have been learning in an application of our own choosing and design. My ParkPlanner app accessed the National Parks api to access National Parks data for details of the park and images.  A user can search for and click on any National Park to see a description, activities you can do in the park, directions to the park, and finally contact information for the park.
